# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting house prices using the **Linear Regression** algorithm. The model is trained on a real-world housing dataset and implemented using **Python** in **Google Colab**. The goal is to understand how different features affect house prices and evaluate the performance of a regression model.

## 📊 Visualization
- Scatter plot showing **Actual vs Predicted House Prices**
- Helps in understanding how close predictions are to actual values

---

## ✅ Results
The Linear Regression model successfully predicts house prices with reasonable accuracy. The R² score indicates how well the model explains the variance in the dataset.
