This project focuses on predicting the quality of wine based on its physicochemical properties using machine learning classification models.
The system analyzes chemical attributes such as acidity, alcohol content, density, and sulphates to classify wine as Good or Bad quality.

The project demonstrates a real-world application of data analytics and machine learning in the field of viticulture.
